## challenge
A brief summary of whats contained here is an organization of data and visualizations to give a clearer insight in outcomes within a certain subcategory(plays). It clearly displays in number the count of Succesful, Failed,Canceled and Live plays. It also shows those same categories in percentages to show a different picture. Another important thing is the visualizations which help in showing trends or patterns. One conclusion is that there is a high failed rate. There is big room for improvement. As far as limitations the main thing that I can advise is being a little bit more detailed by maybe adding more columns. By adding more columns I would be able to show in tables and graphs a different side. Suggestions would be setting clearer goals to create more thoughtful visualizations. Also try to play around with different types of charts to see if the informations gained can help us in any way to see whyin example theres a high the failed rate in plays, and it can give us insight in how we can improve.
